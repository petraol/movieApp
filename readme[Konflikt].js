HOW TO SETUP: 

1. Clone repository.
2. Since the repository already contains the necessary elements for angular to work, having node installed and 
running the command 'npm start' in the terminal set up the app to be available at localhost:8000. If 'npm start' doesn't work, 
a possible solution is to delete the folders node-modules and bower-components, run 'npm install' and then try 'npm start' again.
3. Go to localhost:8000 in your browser, and the app should run!
